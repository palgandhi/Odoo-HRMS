## 🔧 **About That Error Message**

**Error**: "The following employees are not supposed to work during that period: Ava Taylor"

**Explanation**: This is Odoo's leave validation. It checks if employees have overlapping leaves. Ava Taylor already has a leave request for that date, so the system prevents creating another conflicting leave.

**Solution**: 
- Choose different dates
- Or delete the existing leave first
- This is actually a GOOD feature - prevents double-booking!
